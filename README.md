# 🎴 CardForge – Rapid Card-Game Prototyping

*Forge digital card games at lightning speed.*


CardForge turns your ideas (and spreadsheets) into playable prototypes without breaking a sweat. Define your data, design gorgeous cards, and iterate live — all right in your browser.

## Why CardForge?

**CardForge started in a basement full of spreadsheets, command‑line scripts, and half‑finished decks.**  
I built it to slash the grunt work, so anyone with a spark of an idea can print a test deck tonight, gather play‑test notes tomorrow, and iterate before sinking hours into final art. If you’re stepping into tabletop design—or ditching your own tangled prototyping setup—CardForge is your launchpad.

- **Template Designer** — build layouts visually or edit raw JSON.
- **Live Card Editor** — edit on the left, watch it render on the right.
- **Project Dashboard** — juggle multiple game ideas with ease.
- **One-click import/export** — JSON & CSV in, JSON & CSV out.
- **100 % local** — everything lives in your browser until you say otherwise.
- **Made by a fellow card‑game tinkerer** — forged from my own prototype pains, so you skip the headaches.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Clone & Install**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/cardforge.git
   cd cardforge
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # open http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. **Follow the in‑app tour** — the *Getting Started* page builds your first deck in five minutes flat.

## 🛠️ Core Workflow

Here’s the exact loop I follow whenever a new concept grabs me—steal it and make it yours.

1. **Forge Templates**  
   Build reusable card blueprints in the **Template Designer**. Pick fields like `name`, `cost`, or `effectText`, then arrange them visually.
2. **Create a Project**  
   On the **Dashboard**, click **New Project**, pick your templates, and give your game a snazzy name.
3. **Add Cards & Iterate**  
   Open the **Live Card Editor** to fill out data and preview every tweak instantly.
4. **Share or Export**  
   Export your deck as JSON or CSV for play‑testing, printing, or feeding into your engine.

## Creator’s Note

CardForge doubles as my personal sandbox for levelling up as a product‑and‑UX human. Every feature ships only after a round of real‑world play‑testing (with friends who are brutally honest).  
If something feels clunky, open an issue or tweet at me—I’m probably already scheming a fix during a late‑night prototyping sprint.

## 🌱 Roadmap
- [ ] Cloud sync (Firebase or Supabase)  
- [ ] Advanced deck validation  
- [ ] AI image & effect generation  
- [ ] Print‑ready PDF export

Built with ❤️ and far too many play‑tests.
