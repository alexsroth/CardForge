# CardForge AI Workspace

This workspace is split into two tracks:

1. `implementation-ready/`

- Export-ready artifacts and build guidelines for the implementation team.

1. `planning/`

- Product review, discovery, decision history, and exploratory research.

Use `implementation-ready/` as the source for execution.
Use `planning/` for rationale and historical context.
